# PublicHolidays

An offline database with APIs to check if a given date is on a public holiday for a given region.

Contains public holidays of over 100 countries from start of 2020 to end of 2029.

## Usage

This library basically has just **two main functions** and **two supporting functions**.

Here's how to use the main functions:

```Swift
// First main function returns list of public holidays for a given location:
try PublicHolidays.all(countryCode: "US")
// => [PublicHoliday(localName: "New Year's Day", date: "2020-01-01"), ...]

try PublicHolidays.all(countryCode: "US", subTerritoryCode: "DC")
// => [PublicHoliday(localName: "New Year's Day", date: "2020-01-01"), ...]


// Second main checks if a given date is on a public holiday for a given location:
try PublicHolidays.contains(date: Date(), country: "FR")
// => true/false

try PublicHolidays.contains(date: Date(), country: "GB", subTerritoryCode: "ENG")
// => true/false
```

Note that `subTerritoryCode` is optional and has a default value of `nil`. Each `PublicHoliday` consists of a `localName: String` and a `date: Date`. Technically speaking, you can also specify a custom `timeZone` to use when loading the public holidays, but it is discouraged to do that unless you really know what you're doing. By default, the calculation will be using the current time zone of the device so passing a `timeZone` shouldn't be necessary in most cases.

If you provide a `countryCode` or a `subTerritoryCode` for which no data is available in this library, the method will throw an error. To prevent this, there are two supporting functions that tell you for which data is available:

```Swift
PublicHolidays.availableCountries() // => ["US", "DE", "JP", "FR", ...]
try PublicHolidays.availableSubTerritories(countryCode: "GB") // => ["ENG", "NIR", "SCT", "WLS"]
```
